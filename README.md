# react-redux-reaction
React-redux basic chat app with emoji reactions (using pubnub)

## Concepts
- **Pub/Sub** is a pattern that enables communication in a network based on publishing messages to channels, and subscribing to those messages.

- **React context** is a way to share data between many components, without having to manually pass objects down through props.

- **The Context Provider Component** uses a value property to provide data to any nested component through its context field.

- The **Redux devtools** is an extension that allows you to examine the redux store state, and see actions being dispatched in real time.
